<h2>I respect you</h2>
</div>

<div>
<strong>No ads. Ever.</strong><br>
I'll never put ads on my content. No popups begging for consent. No tracking. I pay Fathom Analytics to respect your privacy and give me only anonymous counts of visits per country.
</div>

<div>
<strong>Creative honesty.</strong><br>
If I use someone's work, they're named and linked. If I miss a credit, tell me and I'll fix it fast.<br>
I use AI in my creative process and I'm always upfront and open about it.

<div>
<strong>Fair use works both ways.</strong><br>
If you use my work, please credit me clearly and link back.
</div>

<div>
<strong>Funding.</strong><br>
Ludic RPG is self-funded. I create and maintain everything on my own time and budget.<br>
If you choose to support me, I'll always explain how the funds are used but I keep my creative freedom.
